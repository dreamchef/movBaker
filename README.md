Convert .mov files (Mac screen recordings, iPhone) to .m4v files you can edit in Premiere Pro.  Faster than manually fixing large amounts of footage.

Guide:
1. Place movBaker.py in the folder containing the .mov files you want to prepare.  There can be other non-.mov in the folder as well, movBaker won't damage them
2. Run movBaker with 'python movBaker.py'
